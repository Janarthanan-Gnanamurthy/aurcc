The core objective of the University is to work for the upliftment of humanity at large. We are receiving increasing recognition and accolades nationally and internationally; we have been scaling greater heights in university rankings and are committed to attaining even better positions in the coming days. We have ambitious plans to demonstrate exponential growth in the coming years. Our academic departments and research centres span the fields of engineering, technology, science, management, and architecture, working in collaboration with regional and national partners to find pragmatic solutions to a wide range of societal and business challenges. Untiring efforts will always be invested in revamping the curriculum with contemporary methods of blended learning, and the focus will be on attaining academic excellence. Effective strategies will be implemented towards: creating a multidisciplinary research ecosystem, translating research into innovation, product development, technology transfer, business incubation, and creating job givers instead of job seekers. In addition to the above, we are consistently striving towards establishing an efficient and continuous Internal Quality Assurance System, best practices, benchmarking, and green initiatives. The university is situated in a serene environment. The serenity, along with a multifaceted structure of curricular, co-curricular, and extra-curricular activities, will shape holistic physical, mental, and intellectual growth for students. The present governance of Anna University assures a transparent management system with a participative organizational structure, motivating the star performers through awards and incentives. The University puts in sustained efforts to create brand equity in all its intellectual pursuits. On behalf of the University family, I wish the students an enjoyable learning experience while pursuing their objectives, making the University proud of their attainments. I assure the students that your talent will be honed, and you will be exposed to a cutting-edge and competitive environment through your zealous participation in the corporate life of this great alma mater. Anna University, the exemplary temple of learning, has created several eminent personalities in the past, and we hope to see more in the near future.",signature:"Dr. R.
